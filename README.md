## Description

This website was created to provide a user the ability to create a customized, secure, auto-generated password. After selecting the "Generate Password" button the user will be prompted first for the desired character length of their password. The length of the password must be greater than 7 and less than 129 characters. Next they will be prompted to confirm if they need special characters, numeric characters, upper case characters and/or lower case characters. After the needed information has been provided an auto-generated password will be created for the user and written to the page.
